### What is a hackathon?

Great Question! A hackathon is an event where student hackers bring their
passion for technology to create a new project coded from scratch. It’s a chance
to collaborate and create something unique in any number of forms - an app, a
robot, a website! You’ll hopefully learn something new along the way in our high
energy, engaging environment! At RevolutionUC, participants are provided with
opportunities to grow while building something they're proud of!

### How long does RevolutionUC last?

Hacking at RevolutionUC lasts for 24 hours, however there is additional time
before and after hacking for introductions and presentations.

### How much does RevolutionUC cost?

RevolutionUC is free for all students enrolled at any accredited university or
high school. Meals, refreshments, snacks, swag, prizes, and great memories are
all included with this completely free cost!

### How do teams register?

Teams are formed at the event. If you already have a team, please make sure
every individual in your team is registered before the event! The maximum team
size is 4.

### What if I don’t have a team?

That's okay! After the opening ceremony, we hold a networking and brainstorming
session to help you find a team and/or project.

### What if I don’t have much experience?

You’re new to hackathons? Wonderful! RevolutionUC is open to all skill levels,
beginners to veterans. There’s nothing we love more than helping our hackers
learn something new while they build something cool!

### Will there be meals, snacks, or refreshments?

Of course! We know our hackers will be busy working so we will have free meals,
snacks, and refreshments to keep you running through the night.

### Should I expect a waiver? You betcha. Before any hacking begins we require you

to sign a waiver which will be emailed to all registered participants prior to
the hackathon. If you are under 18 you will need a parent or legal guardian to
sign the waiver.

### Is there a minimum age for participants?

No, all coders are invited! But if you're under 18, you will need to have a
parent/guardian sign the waiver.

### Where at the University of Cincinnati is the hackathon?

The hackerspace is located in [Rhodes Hall](https://www.uc.edu/content/dam/common/docs/maps/campus_map_west.pdf). Look out for an email before the
hackathon for specific rooms and where to go when you arrive on campus.

### Where do I park?

UC has plenty of parking garages! For a full list, check out UC’s [Maps and
Visitor Info page](https://www.uc.edu/parking/visitors-maps.html). The hackathon occurs on West Campus, so we would recommend
parking at [Woodside Garage](https://www.uc.edu/parking/visitors-maps.html#wa) or [Campus Green Garage](https://www.uc.edu/parking/visitors-maps.html#cg).

### What should I bring?

Please bring a valid school ID for registration, a computer to hack on, any
chargers for your device(s), and a positive attitude. We also recommend bringing
basic toiletries (toothbrush, deodorant, etc), a pillow/blanket (if you choose
to nap). Please note that Ethernet access will be limited, so please plan to use
a Wi-Fi connection.

### Will there be travel reimbursements?

We offer carpool reimbursement on a case by case basis - receipts must be
provided to receive travel reimbursement. We don’t offer reimbursement for
flights. If you’d like more information please do not hesitate to email us at
[info@revolutionuc.com](mailto:info@revolutionuc.com).

### What if I have more questions?

We will have organizers and volunteers present, so don't be shy and ask away!
Feel free to tweet at us at [@Revolution_UC](http://www.twitter.com/Revolution_UC) with the hashtag #AskRevUC or send an
email to [info@revolutionuc.com](mailto:info@revolutionuc.com).

### Is there a Code of Conduct?

Absolutely! We operate on the [Major League Hacking Code of Conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf) to create an
all-inclusive environment for our hackers.
